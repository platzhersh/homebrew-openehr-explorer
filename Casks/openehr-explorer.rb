  # TODO(OEH-7): remove this caveat once release builds are notarized.
  caveats <<~EOS
    openEHR Explorer is not yet notarized by Apple. On first launch, macOS
    Gatekeeper will report the app as damaged. To fix this, run:

      xattr -cr "/Applications/openEHR Explorer.app"

    Then open the app normally. This is a one-time step per install.
